e_binary_search

What is binary search?
It is searching algorithm which is uses divide and conquer method

Steps:

i) List should be sorted first
ii) find middle element
iii) if the element to search is less than middle element then search left side 
    else search in right side. 
    ie split the list like r1 -> list[middle+1] to list[len(list)-1] and l1 - > list[0] to list[middle+1]
    if middle == search element then return middle element
iv) Repeat the step ii) and iii) until you find the search element

example: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], search for 4 -> n=4

i) l = len(arr)
ii) middle = l//2
iii) if n >middle 
     recursion arr[middle+1] to arr[l-1]
iv) elif n<middle
    recursion arr[0] to arr[middle-1]
v) elif arr[middle] == n
    return arr[middle]
